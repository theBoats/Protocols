# CRISPR guide design

## Introduction
This protocol describes how to select guide RNAs.

At the time of writing we are using two different companies to select pre-designed guide RNAs for mouse. i.e. IDT and Synthego. We are ordering guides from Synthego. This is because of their competitive pricing for sgRNA (i.e. a single component guide RNA) which includes base-mods that improve stability and expression. As you will see below, the recommended guides designed by each company can differ significantly and I have not determined which of either is producing superior guides. In the past I have used IDT to manufacture the guide RNAs but theirs is a two component system of crRNA and tracrRNA and is both more expensive and does not contain the same base-mods that Synthego offers. 

## Method

1. Use both the IDT design tool and Synthego design tool to select guide RNAs for your target.
