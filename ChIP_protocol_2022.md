# ChIP PROTOCOL 2022

## Day 0
0. 
	1. Collect a small quantity of dry ice
	2. find a small glass beaker
	3. find some 100% ethanol


1. Fix cells with 1% formaldehyde for 15' with rocking
	1. Prepare stocks of 10% paraformaldehyde then add 1 mL per 10 mL of cells in media
	
2. Quench fixation with glycine; final concentration 0.125M
	1. Prepare a stock of 1.375M glycine then add 1 mL per 11 mL of crosslinked cells
	
3. Wash cells with PBS to remove residual formaldehyde and snap freeze
	1. move cells to a 50 mL falcon
	2. spin down cells (500 rcf 5') and remove formaldehyde / glycine with a vacuum sucker
	3. wash cells with 1 mL PBS and transfer to eppendorf tube
	4. spin down cells (500 rcf 5') and remove PBS
	5. resuspend cell pellet in 1 mL PBS 
	6. spin eppendorf tube (500 rcf 5') and remove PBS
	7. prepare dry-ice ethanol bath
	8. snap freeze cell pellet in dry-ice ethanol bath and place at -80oC until ready to use

## Day 1 

1. Lyse cells in 1 mL of lysis buffer + protease inhibitor (prepare 960 uL lysis buffer + 40 uL 25X protease inhibitor)
> To make 25X protease inhibitor dissolve one tablet in 2 mL water. Tablets are found in the 4oC fridge. Use the tablets with EDTA.

2. Sonicate cells in covaris M220, 1 mL tube with fibre. 

These settings work for K1 / K1ER cells (stored as the program 'Graham 20 mins'):

- Target size 200-700 bp
- PIP 75
- Duty factor 10%
- CPB 200-700
- Treatment time 20 mins (30'' on 30'' off)
- Setpoint Temperature 7oC
- Min/Max temperature 4/10oC
- Cell number 20 million
- Water level FULL
- Sample volume 1 mL

3. Dilute sonicated chromatin with 9 mL modified RIPA buffer (transfer to 15 mL falcon tube)
4. Remove 4% as input DNA (400 uL) and store at -20oC until required
5. Add antibody to chromatin/RIPA; 0.5-1 ug per million cells is a rough guide; for antisera I've used 10-14 uL
6. Incubate overnight at 4oC on rotating wheel

## Day 2 
1. Add protein A/G dynabeads
	1. Wash 50 uL of dynabeads with modified RIPA buffer twice on magnetic stand
	2. add to chromatin 

	> choice of A/G will depend on antibody isotype and species
	
2. incubate on rotating wheel for 2 hours at 4oC
3. remove supernatant using giant magnet or cycle through 2 mL eppendorf tube on 1 mL magnet
4. transfer beads to eppendorf tube and wash with the following order:
	1.  3x wash
	2. 3x final wash
	3. 1x LiCL wash
	4. 1x TE

5. Elute from beads with elution buffer
	1. use 400 uL elution buffer + 1uL RNaseA (10 mg / mL) and 1 uL Proteinase K (20 mg / mL)

6. De-crosslink eluate at 65oC overnight with shaking at 900 rpm
	1. Get the input out of the freezer and add 1uL RNaseA (10 mg / mL) and 1 uL Proteinase K (20 mg / mL)
	2. De-crosslink overnight as per the ChIP sample
	
## Day 3

1. Purify ChIP and input DNA with Qiagen minelute column; elute in 50 uL
